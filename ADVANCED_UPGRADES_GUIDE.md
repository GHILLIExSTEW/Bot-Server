# 🚀 Advanced Upgrades Guide - Beyond PebbleHost Limitations

## Overview
This guide showcases the advanced features and upgrades now possible after migrating from PebbleHost to self-hosted PostgreSQL infrastructure.

## 🎯 What Was Limited by PebbleHost

### ❌ PebbleHost Limitations
- **MySQL Only**: Limited to basic MySQL features
- **Shared Resources**: CPU/memory constraints
- **No Custom Extensions**: Can't install database extensions
- **Limited Storage**: Fixed storage allocation
- **No Geographic Features**: No PostGIS support
- **Basic Analytics**: No advanced window functions
- **No Real-time Features**: Limited concurrent processing
- **Restricted APIs**: Can't add custom endpoints
- **No Machine Learning**: No ML model deployment
- **Limited Monitoring**: Basic logging only

## ✅ New Capabilities with Self-Hosted PostgreSQL

### 1. **Advanced Analytics Engine**

#### Real-Time Leaderboards
```python
# Now possible with PostgreSQL window functions
async def get_real_time_leaderboard():
    query = """
    SELECT 
        u.username,
        COUNT(b.id) as total_bets,
        AVG(b.bet_amount) as avg_bet,
        SUM(CASE WHEN b.bet_result = 'win' THEN b.bet_amount * b.odds ELSE 0 END) as total_winnings,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(CASE WHEN b.bet_result = 'win' THEN b.bet_amount * b.odds ELSE 0 END) DESC) as rank,
        LAG(SUM(CASE WHEN b.bet_result = 'win' THEN b.bet_amount * b.odds ELSE 0 END)) 
            OVER (ORDER BY DATE(b.created_at)) as prev_day_winnings
    FROM users u
    JOIN bets b ON u.id = b.user_id
    WHERE b.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY u.id, u.username, DATE(b.created_at)
    ORDER BY rank, DATE(b.created_at) DESC

```

#### Predictive Analytics
```python

```

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**

#### Materialized Views
```sql
-- Cached analytics for fast queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_stats AS
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as bet_date,
    COUNT(*) as total_bets,
    SUM(bet_amount) as total_volume,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users,
    AVG(CASE WHEN bet_result = 'win' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as win_rate
FROM bets 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Auto-refresh every hour
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_daily_stats()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_stats;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Partitioning for Large Datasets
```sql
-- Partition bets table by month for better performance
CREATE TABLE bets_partitioned (
    LIKE bets INCLUDING ALL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE bets_2024_01 PARTITION OF bets_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE bets_2024_02 PARTITION OF bets_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');
```
